# odin-admin-dashboard
This is an exercise to style an admin dashboard using CSS Grid. Extra features/implementations have been intentionally deprioritized for this learning exercise. 

## Technology Used 
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Git
In particular:
* HTML
* CSS Grid + responsive Grid 

## Lessons Learnt
* Grid is used when you have a clear layout in mind (layout-first); however it can be flexible and responsive with the help of `fr` fractional units and `auto-fit`/`auto-fill` values for use in the `repeat` Grid function 
* Grid positioning using: `grid-columns`, `grid-rows`, `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` (and its corresponding row properties), `grid-template-areas`

## Future opportunities
* Adding hyperlinks to navigation links, buttons
* Adding icons to navigation links
* Adding responsive styling to buttons (shadow on click, for e.g.)
* Making the page responsive for viewing on mobile
